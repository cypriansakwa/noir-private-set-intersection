# Hash-Based Private Set Intersection (PSI)

This circuit allows a prover to demonstrate that the intersection between their private set A and a public set B has a known result (e.g., a specific number of overlapping items), **without revealing the full contents of A**.

This project demonstrates a robust **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** circuit using **Noir** for privacy-preserving verification of private set intersection. The circuit allows you to prove, in zero-knowledge, that the intersection between your private set and a public set has a specified cardinality, **without revealing your private set**.

## 📝 Circuit Description

### What does the circuit do?

- **Public Input/Output:**
  - `b` (`[Field; 4]`): The public set (4 elements).
  - `expected_count` (`Field`): The expected intersection count.
- **Private Inputs:**
  - `a` (`[Field; 4]`): The private set (4 elements).

The circuit:
1. **Deduplicates** both sets, padding with a sentinel value (`0`).
2. **Hashes** each unique element using Poseidon.
3. **Counts** the number of hashed elements that appear in both sets.
4. **Asserts** the intersection count matches `expected_count`.

**Important:** Inputs must NOT contain the value `0`, which is reserved as a sentinel for padding.  
If your domain allows `0` as a valid input, you must change the sentinel value in the circuit.

### Key Constraint

$$
\text{count} = |\text{dedup}(a) \cap \text{dedup}(b)|
$$

### Example Circuit Code

```rust
mod poseidon;

/// Deduplicates a 4-element array, pads with sentinel (0).
/// NOTE: Inputs must NOT contain 0; 0 is reserved as padding.
fn dedup(input: [Field; 4]) -> ([Field; 4], u32) {
    let mut out = [0; 4];
    let mut count = 0;
    for i in 0..4 {
        let mut seen = 0;
        for j in 0..i {
            seen += if input[i] == input[j] { 1 } else { 0 };
        }
        if seen == 0 {
            out[count] = input[i];
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    (out, count)
}

fn hash_set(set: [Field; 4], n: u32) -> [Field; 4] {
    let mut hashed = [0; 4];
    for i in 0..4 {
        if i < n {
            hashed[i] = poseidon::bn254::hash_1([set[i]]);
        }
    }
    hashed
}

fn count_intersection(a: [Field; 4], n_a: u32, b: [Field; 4], n_b: u32) -> Field {
    let mut count = 0;
    for i in 0..4 {
        if i < n_a {
            let mut found = 0;
            for j in 0..4 {
                if j < n_b {
                    found += if a[i] == b[j] { 1 } else { 0 };
                }
            }
            count += if found > 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        }
    }
    count
}

/// Main entry point.
/// Asserts that input sets contain no 0s (which is reserved for padding).
fn main(
    a: [Field; 4],          // private set
    b: [Field; 4],          // public set
    expected_count: Field,  // public expected intersection count
) -> pub Field {
    // Enforce: inputs must not contain 0!
    for i in 0..4 {
        assert(a[i] != 0);
        assert(b[i] != 0);
    }

    let (a_dedup, n_a) = dedup(a);
    let (b_dedup, n_b) = dedup(b);

    let hashed_a = hash_set(a_dedup, n_a);
    let hashed_b = hash_set(b_dedup, n_b);

    let count = count_intersection(hashed_a, n_a, hashed_b, n_b);
    assert(count == expected_count);
    count
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

The circuit includes tests for passing and failing cases, e.g.:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_intersection_2() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let b = [3, 4, 5, 6];
    let expected_count = 2;
    let result = main(a, b, expected_count);
    assert(result == expected_count);
}

#[test]
fn test_intersection_0() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let b = [5, 6, 7, 8];
    let expected_count = 0;
    let result = main(a, b, expected_count);
    assert(result == expected_count);
}

#[test]
fn test_intersection_full_overlap() {
    let a = [9, 10, 11, 12];
    let b = [12, 11, 10, 9];
    let expected_count = 4;
    let result = main(a, b, expected_count);
    assert(result == expected_count);
}

#[test]
fn test_intersection_with_duplicates() {
    let a = [1, 1, 2, 3];
    let b = [2, 2, 3, 4];
    let expected_count = 2;
    let result = main(a, b, expected_count);
    assert(result == expected_count);
}

#[should_fail]
fn test_wrong_count_fails() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let b = [3, 4, 5, 6];
    let expected_count = 3;
    let _ = main(a, b, expected_count); // This should fail
}
```
